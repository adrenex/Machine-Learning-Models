Visualize a Decision Tree on Iris dataset
A Decision Tree is a supervised algorithm used in machine learning. 
It is using a binary tree graph (each node has two children) to assign for each data sample a target value. 
The target values are presented in the tree leaves. To reach to the leaf, the sample is propagated through nodes, 
starting at the root node. 
In each node a decision is made, to which descendant node it should go. 
A decision is made based on the selected sampleâ€™s feature. 
Decision Tree learning is a process of finding the optimal rules in each internal tree node according to the selected metric.
