XGBoost
XGBoost is an open-source software library that implements optimized distributed gradient boosting machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework.

What is XGBoost?
XGBoost, which stands for Extreme Gradient Boosting, is a scalable, distributed gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) machine learning library. It provides parallel tree boosting and is the leading machine learning library for regression, classification, and ranking problems.

It’s vital to an understanding of XGBoost to first grasp the machine learning concepts and algorithms that XGBoost builds upon: supervised machine learning, decision trees, ensemble learning, and gradient boosting.

Supervised machine learning uses algorithms to train a model to find patterns in a dataset with labels and features and then uses the trained model to predict the labels on a new dataset’s features.
