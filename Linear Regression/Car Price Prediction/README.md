# Linear Regression Model for Car Price Prediction

Analyzing a car price predication dataset for finding out price of cars on different parameters. Exploratory Data Analysis, split the training and testing data, Model Evaluation and Predictions. 

This model helps to predict the price for cars, depending upon various independent units.
Multiple Linear Regression is implemented.

This dataset contains information about used cars.
This data can be used for a lot of purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of linear regression in Machine Learning.
The columns in the given dataset are as follows:

name
year
selling_price
km_driven
fuel
seller_type
transmission
Owner

Here in this, we replaced non integer data, as we are using linear regression, by integer values, so that they can be considered as independent variables.
