# Wine-Quality-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project is about creating a machine learning algorithm that can predict the quality of wine based on the given dataset.

These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).
