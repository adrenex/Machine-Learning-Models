# Logistic Regression Model for Titanic Survival Prediction

Analyzing a Titanic Survival Dataset. Exploratory Data Analysis, split the training and testing data, Model Evaluation and Predictions. 

This model helps to predict whether or not a passenger survived in titanic disaster.
Multivariate Logistic Regression is implemented.

Dataset contains 8 columns with CSV extension. The data contains the following columns :

survival : Survival 0 = No, 1 = Yes

pclass : Ticket class 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd

sex : Sex

Age : Age in years

sibsp : Number of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic

parch # of parents / children aboard the Titanic

ticket : Ticket number fare Passenger fare cabin Cabin number

embarked : Port of Embarkation C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton
